      <p>
            Born and raised in the suburbs of Charlotte, I have come to enjoy the never ending adventures that accompany this growing city. I fill my week days with work but my nights and weekends are full of soccer leagues, brewery exploring, and attempts to be the coolest aunt to my niece. I enjoy going to the library (yes, the physical library) because there is something about that slightly stale smell and a physical book in hand that I cannot deny my love for. Along with this old-fashioned love, I am an avid fan of letterpress. After working in a letterpress shop for three years, I have learned the roots of typography and cultivated a great love of fonts, thus solidifying my nerd status, if still going to the library did not already accomplish that. I am an advocate of always embracing your quirks.
